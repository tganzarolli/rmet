    <h1>You answered <span id="correct-ratio"></span>% of the questions correctly.</h1>

    <p><b>How did others do on this test?</b><br>
        On average, other people answered 74% questions correctly.
        <span class="quiet">But we found that not everyone does the same on this test:</span>
    </p><ul class="quiet">
        <li>Women, on average, perform 2% better than men.</li>
        <li>Young people under 18 score substantially lower than adults.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    

    <p><b>Does this test work equally well for all people around the world?</b><br>
        This test was developed in Great Britain and the images you saw were taken from British magazines in 1990's.
        Unsurprisingly, the test doesn't work perfectly for people who are not native speakers of English or for people who come
        from cultures that are very different from Britain's.
    </p>

    <p><b>Should you worry if you got a low score?</b><br>
        No.  Your screen lighting level, mood, fatigue and many other factors might have affected your score.  The results
        of this test are useful when they are averaged across many people, but they can be inaccurate for any
        individual person.

            <b>Typical results.</b>
            In the original experiments with this test, the average score for
            British adults was 26.  The average result for students was 28.
            However, individual results ranged from 17 to 35 as many factors may
            affect performance: the lighting, the quality of your screen, your
            emotional state, fatigue, not to mention knowledge of the English
            language.

            <b>Social intelligence and team-based problem solving.</b>
            Recent research published in Science in 2010 demonstrated that there
            is a link between how well team members perform on this test and how
            well the team performs on complex problem solving tasks.  In fact, the
            overall "social intelligence" (or "collective intelligence" as it is
            referred to in the paper) was more than five times more important to
            the team success than the average IQ of the team members!
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides this test, there were two other factors that were found to be
            important for team success: how equally team members contributed to
            the conversations (teams where one person dominated the conversation
            performed less well than those where all members contributed roughly
            the same),
            and the number of women on the team (yes, the more women, the better
            the team did! Sorry guys...).
